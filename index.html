      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>After a long road, full of unexpected twists and turns, I decided it's time to go in a new direction and follow those dreams I'd had locked away. It's been a good 'ol life, I've been a father, a friend, I've met people all across this country, worked in all kinds of different fields in different roles, & there's been one truth I've learned; life is what you make of it. It's never too late to follow your heart, as long as you're still breathing there's still hope.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Oringally Charleston, WV, but I've lived many places over the years working on the road from San Fransico to NYC</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Writing, hiking, traveling, gaming, and always up to try something new</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Software Developer</p>
      <h1>Where Do You Live</h1>
      <p>Gainesville GA (northeast of Atlanta)</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Creating new ideas, finding solutions to problems, having the opportunity to explore & imagine new possibilities, there's nothing else I'd rather be doing</p>
